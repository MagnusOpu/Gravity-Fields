		GRAVITY ESSENCE GENERATOR
			INTRODUCTION
				This machine will be the core of the mod, generating gravity essence by consuming gravity ore.

				Where G = Glass
				Where I = Iron Block
				Where B = Gravity Block
			POWERED WITH
				Gravity Ore

		GRAVITY BLOCK
			INTRODUCTION
				Block constructed out of Gravity Ore. Used in construction of Gravity Essence Generator.

		GRAVITY FIELD GENERATOR
			INTRODUCTION
				Generated gravitational field with varying degrees of strength and in varying ranges dependent on gravity strength stone
				and gravity range chip. Defaults to a base strength and/or range without gravity stones.

		GRAVITY STRENGTH STONE
			INTRODUCTION
				Right clicking opens up a menu that can be used to set the gravity stone's strength. Putting the strength stone into a
				gravity field generator will then alter the field generator's effective strength to the gravity stone's strength.

		GRAVITY RANGE STONE
			INTRODUCTION
				Right clicking opens up a menu that can be used to set the gravity stone's range. Putting the range stone into a
				gravity field generator will then alter the field generator's effective range to the gravity stone's range.

	NATURAL RESOURCE IDEAS

		GRAVITY ORE
			INTRODUCTION
				This ore will be naturally generated in clusters of 2-4, and will drop a single gravity ore upon destruction as well as a 10% chance of
				dropping a gravity strength stone and a 10% chance of dropping a gravity range stone.
