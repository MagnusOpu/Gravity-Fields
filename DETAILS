		GRAVITY MACHINE
			INTRODUCTION
				This machine will be the core of the mod, generating gravity essence by consuming gravity ore.
			RECIPE
				G I G

				G I G
				Where G = Glass
				Where I = Iron Block
				Where B = Gravity Block
			POWERED WITH
				Gravity Ore
				
		GRAVITY PIPE
			INTRODUCTION
				Channels generated gravity along pipes to move it from one place to another.

		GRAVITY BLOCK
			INTRODUCTION
				Block constructed out of Gravity Ore. Used in construction of Gravity Machine.

		GRAVITY FIELD GENERATOR
			INTRODUCTION
				Generated gravitational field with varying degrees of strength and in varying distances dependent on gravity strength stone
				and gravity distance chip. Defaults to a base strength and/or distance without gravity stones.

		GRAVITY STRENGTH STONE
			INTRODUCTION
				Right clicking opens up a menu that can be used to set the gravity stone's strength. Putting the strength stone into a
				gravity field generator will then alter the field generator's effective strength to the gravity stone's strength.

		GRAVITY DISTANCE STONE
			INTRODUCTION
				Right clicking opens up a menu that can be used to set the gravity stone's distance. Putting the distance stone into a
				gravity field generator will then alter the field generator's effective range to the gravity stone's distance.

		GRAVITY ORE
			INTRODUCTION
				This ore will be naturally generated in clusters of 2-4, and will drop a single gravity ore upon destruction.
